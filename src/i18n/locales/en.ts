      title: 'About Me',
      content1: "I'm Arturo. A Computer Scientist in Madrid which loves AI related projects. Since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by the power of technology and computers. I built myself my first computer when I was 16 years old and I've been coding ever since. When I was 18, I built my first NAS server for myself and started learning about networking and cloud computing. Now, I'm finishing my degree in Computer Science and I had the opportunity to work with many people and in different countries.",
      content2: "My journey in technology has led me to work on various exciting projects, for example, an AI model that predicts brain tumors with MRI images. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what's possible."
